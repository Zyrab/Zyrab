### Zyrab | dev, builder, curious soul

i make things.  
sometimes tools. sometimes games. sometimes mistakes that teach me more than books ever did.

no bootcamps. no certificates. just a lot of code, a lot of failing better every time.

---

**🧠 projects?**  
i build engines, editors, and apps for humans—especially small ones learning big things.

**🌍 open to:**  
remote gigs, cool collabs, and coffee-fueled problem solving.

you like clean architecture, canvas hacks, gamedev, or just figuring stuff out loud.
